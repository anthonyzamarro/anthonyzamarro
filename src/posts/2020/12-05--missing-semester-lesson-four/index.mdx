In this fourth lesson of the [missing semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/data-wrangling/) series, we look at the various ways we can manipulate data using the command line. This seems like a very practical lesson for taking care of every day or mundane tasks. It looks at a variety of shell commands and introduces [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).

### Exercises

1. Take this [short interactive regex tutorial](https://regexone.com/).
	- I'm already familiar with regular expressions, but could always use more practice and this tutorial was a nice review. Regex can be confusing but powerful once you get some of the basics down.

2. Find the number of words (in `/usr/share/dict/words`) that contain at least three `a`s and don't have a `'s` ending. What are the three most common last two letters of those words? `sed`'s `y` command, or the `tr` program, may help you with case insensitivity. How many of those two-letter combinations are there? And for a challenge: which combinations do not occur?

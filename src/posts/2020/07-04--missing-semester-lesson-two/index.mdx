This is the second lesson in the [Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) series. While the [first lesson](blog/2020/07-03--misssing-semester-lesson-one/07-03--missing-semester-lesson-one/) introduced us to the Shell, lesson two digs a little deeper and also introduces scripting concepts.

## [Lesson 2: Shell Tools and Scripting](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/shell-tools/)

### Challenges

#### Question 1 
Read [man ls](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html) and write an `ls` command that lists files in the following manner
- Includes all files, including hidden files
- Sizes are listed in human readable format (e.g. 454M instead of 454279954)
- Files are ordered by recency
- Output is colorized
A sample output would look like this

	-rw-r--r--   1 user group 1.1M Jan 14 09:53 baz
	drwxr-xr-x   5 user group  160 Jan 14 09:53 .
	-rw-r--r--   1 user group  514 Jan 14 06:42 bar
	-rw-r--r--   1 user group 106M Jan 13 12:12 foo
	drwx------+ 47 user group 1.5K Jan 12 18:08 ..

My answer:

`ls -l -G -h -t`

`ls` command lists everything in the current directory.

`-l` lists everything in long format

`-G` colorizes the output

`-h` outputs file size in human readable format

`-t` lists by most recently modified

#### Question 2 
Write bash functions `marco` and `polo` that do the following. Whenever you execute `marco` the current working directory should be saved in some manner, then when you execute `polo`, no matter what directory you are in, `polo` should `cd` you back to the directory where you executed `marco`. For ease of debugging you can write the code in a file `marco.sh` and (re)load the definitions to your shell by executing `source marco.sh`.

My answer:

In `marco.sh`:
	
	#!/bi/sh
	marco() {
		echo "modified at " $(date -r ~/saved/saved.sh)
		echo "$(pwd)" >> ~/saved/saved.sh
		echo "now modified at " $(date -r ~/saved/saved.sh)
	}

- First, I'm printing out the time when the file `saved.sh` is last modified.
- Second, I append the current working directory I'm in into that file
- Third, I print out the newly modified time

In `polo.sh`

	#!/bi/sh
	polo() {
		tag=$( tail -n 1 ~/saved/saved.sh)
		cd $tag
	}

- First, I store the final line of `saved.sh` into a variable. This line tells me the full path of the last directory in which `marco.sh` was executed.
- Then, I just `cd` into that directory.

Admittedly, this one gave me a little trouble at first as I didn't think to save the `pwd` path into a separate folder all together. And the source that I found for reading the final line of a file can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42987486/how-to-read-the-last-line-of-a-text-file-into-a-variable-using-bash).

#### Question 3 
Say you have a command that fails rarely. In order to debug it you need to capture its output but it can be time consuming to get a failure run. Write a bash script that runs the following script until it fails and captures its standard output and error streams to files and prints everything at the end. Bonus points if you can also report how many runs it took for the script to fail.

```
	#!/usr/bin/env bash

	n=$(( RANDOM % 100 ))

	if [[ n -eq 42 ]]; then
	    echo "Something went wrong"
	    >&2 echo "The error was using magic numbers"
	    exit 1
	fi

	echo "Everything went according to plan"
```

My answer:

In a file called `question_3.sh`
```
	#!/usr/bin/env bash

	question_3 () {
		 n=$(( RANDOM % 100 ))

		 if [[ n -eq 42 ]]; then
		    echo "Something went wrong"
		    >&2 echo "The error was using magic numbers"
		    echo "The process ran" $1 "times" >> ./saved.sh
		    >&2 echo "STDERR" 1 >> ./saved.sh
		    exit 1
		 fi

		 echo "Everything went according to plan"
	}


	get_result () {
		c=0

		question_3

		while [[ $? -ne 1 ]]; 
		do
			echo $?
			echo "STDOUT" $? >> ./saved.sh
			c=`expr $c + 1`
			question_3 "$c"
		done
	}
```

I ended up slightly modifying the original code so that I could capture the STDERR code. Since my default interactive shell actually uses `zsh`, every time there is an `exit` command, my shell switches to `zsh`, so to make my life a little easier I just decided to update the given code a little bit. All I'm doing there is echoing the number of times the code runs and appending that line with the status code into a file in the same directory called `saved.sh`

In my custom `get_result()` function, I first set a variable `c` to zero so that I can count how many times the process was run. Then, I call the function `question_3`. I do this so that `$?` always captures the status code of that command. Then I start a `while` loop that runs until the status code of the previous command is equal to 1.

Then, I echo the status code, followed by appending the code into the `saved.sh` file. After, I increment the `c` variable by one and then in the final line of the `while` loop, I pass that variable to the `question_3` function. I have to call this function inside the `while` loop in order to keep the loop going and once the variable `n` in that function equals 42, then we can finally break out of the loop.

#### Question 4
As we covered in the lecture `find`’s `-exec` can be very powerful for performing operations over the files we are searching for. However, what if we want to do something with all the files, like creating a zip file? As you have seen so far commands will take input from both arguments and STDIN. When piping commands, we are connecting STDOUT to STDIN, but some commands like tar take inputs from arguments. To bridge this disconnect there’s the [xargs](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/xargs.1.html) command which will execute a command using STDIN as arguments. For example `ls | xargs rm` will delete the files in the current directory.

Your task is to write a command that recursively finds all HTML files in the folder and makes a zip with them. Note that your command should work even if the files have spaces (hint: check `-d` flag for `xargs`)

My answer:

This one tripped me up a little bit because the `-d` flag for `xargs` doesn't exist on Mac OS and that is my OS. Instead, I have to use the `-0` flag in conjunction with the `-print0` in the STDOUT. Here is what I wrote:

`find . -type f -name "*.html" -print0 | xargs -0 zip all_files.zip`

I am piping all files that have an html extension in the current directory into `xargs` which then passes from STDOUT as arguments to the `zip` command and then creating a file called `all_files.zip`. This works pretty well. As mentioned before, the `-0` and `-print0` are for files that have whitespace.

#### Question 5
(Advanced) Write a command or script to recursively find the most recently modified file in a directory. More generally, can you list all files by recency?

My answer:

`find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 ls -l -t`

Find every file in the current directory (including child directories) and pass as arguments using `xargs` (ignoring whitespaces in file names) and verbosely list by most recently modified.

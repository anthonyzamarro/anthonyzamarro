In the third lesson in the [missing semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) series, we learn vim. Vim is a text editor that's based entirely in the command line. The point is to minimize as much typing as possible and not use the cursor. I have to say, so far this has been my favorite lesson not just because I really enjoyed the teacher and the lesson itself but also because I've found vim to be frustrating to learn at first but really productive and fun the better I've gotten.

At first, vim is a real painm especially coming from text editors that give you a lot out of the box. But I soon saw the advantage of not relying on the mouse and actually thinking about more efficient ways of getting my work done through a text based editor. I've also liked having the control to basically start from scratch and install plugins as I see fit rather than have things out of the box. I will still go back and use a different editor if I'm at work and I need to quickly get something done, but I'm finding myself using vim for almost all of my tasks and my goal is to use it entirely at some point.

### Challenges

1. Complete `vimtutor`.

	`vimtutor` is the beginner guide to vim. I found it really useful. There are seven lessons in total each with sub-lessons. They are pretty straight forward, so what I will do is give a summary of each lesson with the commands you learn. This can act as a sort of "cheat sheet" as well for when I need to recall how to do something.

	### Cusor Movements
	Command | Description
	---	| ---
	j	| move up	
	k 	| move down	
	h	| move left
	l	| move right
	$	| go to end of the line
	0	| go to beginning of the line
	e	| go to end of next word
	w	| go to start of next word
	b	| go back to the start of the previous word
	
	### Appending, Undoing
	Command | Description
	---	| ---
	a	| go to end of current word and enter insert mode
	A	| go to the end of the line and enter insert mode
	u	| undo last command
	U	| undo line to its original state
	CTRL+R  | to redo commands (undo the undo)

	### Deletion
	Command | Description
	---	| ---
	x	| delete character
	dw	| delete everything until start of next word excluding first character
	de 	| delete everything until end of word including last character
	d$	| delete everything to the end of the line including the last character
	dd	| delete whole line

	* use `operation + movement` commands in combination for more efficiency such as `dw`

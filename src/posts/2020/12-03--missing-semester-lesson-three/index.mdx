title: Missing Semester - Lesson Three - Vim

In the third lesson in the [missing semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) series, we learn Vim. Vim is a text editor that's based entirely in the command line. The point is to minimize as much typing as possible and not use the mouse. I have to say, so far this has been my favorite lesson not just because I really enjoyed the teacher and the lesson itself but also because I've found Vim to be frustrating to learn at first but really productive and fun the better I've gotten.

At first, Vim is a real pain especially coming from editors that give you a lot out of the box. But I soon saw the advantage of not relying on the mouse and actually thinking about more efficient ways of getting my work done through a text based editor. I've also liked having the control to basically start from scratch and install plugins as I see fit rather than have things out of the box. I will still go back and use a different editor if I'm at work and I need to quickly get something done, but I'm finding myself using Vim for almost all of my tasks and my goal is to use it entirely at some point.

### Exercises

1. Complete `Vimtutor`.

	`Vimtutor` is the beginner guide to Vim. I found it really useful. There are seven lessons in total each with sub-lessons. They are pretty straight forward, so what I will do is give a summary of each lesson with the commands you learn. This can act as a sort of "cheat sheet" as well for when I need to recall how to do something.

	### Basic Commands
	Command | Description
	---	| ---
	:w	| save changes to the fil
	:q	| exit file
	:help + command | comprehensive on-line help system for Vim

	### Cusor Movements
	Command | Description
	---	| ---
	j	| move up	
	k 	| move down	
	h	| move left
	l	| move right
	$	| go to end of the line
	0	| go to beginning of the line
	e	| go to end of next word
	w	| go to start of next word
	b	| go back to the start of the previous word
	2w	| go forward by two words
	2b	| go backward by two words
	CTRL+G	| see which line you are on in the file
	n+G	| type file line number and then G to jump to that line
	gg	| jumo to top of file
	G	| jump to bottom of file	
	o	| enter insert mode on a new line below current line
	O	| enter insert mode on a new line above current line

	### Search, Pattern Match
	Command | Description
	---	| ---
	:/pattern | seach for a phrase in the file and go there. jump to matches by pressing n. jump to matches backwards by pressing ?
	%	| find matching ), ], or }
	:s/old/new/g | substitute 'old' with 'new' phrase. the g flag substitutes globally in the file
	:#,#s/old/new/g | change every occurance of character between two lines. #,# are line numbers of the range
	:%s/old/new/gc | find every occurance of character in whole file. the c flag will show a prompt whether or not to subtitute the character

	### Appending, Undoing, Changing
	Command | Description
	---	| ---
	a	| go to end of current word and enter insert mode
	A	| go to the end of the line and enter insert mode
	u	| undo last command
	U	| undo line to its original state
	CTRL+R  | to redo commands (undo the undo)
	ce	| change until the end of a word
	cw	| change until start of the next word
	c$	| change until end of the line
	rx	| replace a character at the cursor
	y	| in visual mode, highlight text to be copied

	dw	| delete everything until start of next word excluding first character
	de 	| delete everything until end of word including last character
	d$	| delete everything to the end of the line including the last character
	dd	| delete whole line
	d2w	| delete words n number of times

	* use `operation + movement` commands in combination for more efficiency such as `dw`
	* use `operation + n + movement` to repeat the command n times

	### External Commands
	Command | Description
	---	| ---
	:!ls	| list files in current directory
	:!file_name | copy current file contents into a new file named file_name	

	* use `:! + shell command` to execute commands on files and directories as if you were in the shell
	* use `v + motion + :w file_name` to save part of the current file into a new or existing file


2. Download our basic Vimrc and save it to ~/.Vimrc.
	- Some features of using Missing Semester's basic Vimrc configuration include numbered lines, prevention of using arrow keys, and syntax highlighting

3. Install and configure the plugin: [crtlp.Vim](https://github.com/ctrlpVim/ctrlp.Vim/blob/master/readme.md).
	```
	cd ~/.Vim
	git clone https://github.com/ctrlpVim/ctrlp.Vim.git bundle/ctrlp.Vim
	```
	In `.Vimrc`:
	```
	let g:ctrlp_map = '<c-p>'
	let g:ctrlp_cmd = 'CtrlP'
	```

4. To practice using Vim, re-do the Demo from the lecture on your own machine.
	- Not going to go through this one as it would take a lot to explain each little thing I would need to do to fix the scrit. Instead, try it yourself and refer back to this page for the commands you can use: https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/editors/#demo


5. Use Vim for all of your text editing for the next month.
	- Done

6. Configure your other tools to use Vim bindings
	- I've installed the Chrome Vim exntension and I use it all the time. It is awesome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/Vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en

7. Further customize your `.Vimrc` file and install more plugins.
	- These are the plugins I've installed and love using
		- NERDtree: https://github.com/preserVim/nerdtree/blob/master/README.markdown
		- Lightline: https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.Vim
		- Auto-paits: https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs

8. (Advanced) Convert XML to JSON using Vim macros. 
	- I actually achieved this on my local machine, but have since forgotten the exact set of commands that I used. Basically, a macro in Vim is a repetition of a series of commands. For converting a file like this, it is a very mechanical process but well worth it once you figure it out as it will save you tons of time.

I recently discovered a nice, short course freely available by MIT called [Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/). It's a pragmatic course for computer science students to become acquanted with tools that they will be using every day on the job. It's a nice departure from the theoretical topics of a CS degree. I don't have a CS degree, but nonetheless I found this course to be interesting and useful.

There are a total of eleven lessons each lasting about an hour. If you navigate to the Missing Semester website, you will see that they offer challenges at the end of each lesson. I haven't found an answers key for this particular course, so I'd like to document my answers in a series of blog posts. I encourage anyone to provide constructive criticisms, comments, or suggestions. 

## [Lesson 1: Course overview + the shell](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/course-shell/)

### Challenges

1. Create a new directory called `missing` under `/tmp`

	This is pretty straightforward:
	`mkdir missing /tmp`

2. Look up the `touch` program. The `man` program is your friend.

	When I do this, I get a lot of information about the program. It includes a definition, description, and list of options. The command is known to create files, but according to the `man` page it can also be used to change the modification and access time of a file. In question three below, we are asked to make a file called `semester` and when I do that, we see the following timestamp:
	
	![Before timestamp says July 3 13:36](../../../images/missing/missing_l1_q2_before.png "Before timestamp says July 3 13:36")

	After running the command `touch -mt 201907030000 semester` the timestamp now looks like this:

	![After timestamp says July 3 2019](../../../images/missing/missing_l1_q2_after.png "After timestamp says July 3 2019")

	(help with this syntax found [here](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-change-a-file-s-last-modified-and-creation-dates-on-mac-os-x-494f8f76cdf4))
	
	The flags `-mt` are for modify and time, and as can be seen we have changed the modification time of when the `semester` file was created to a different timestamp.

3. Use `touch` to create a new file called `semester` in missing.

	My answer:
	
	`touch semester ./missing`

4. Write the following into that file, one line at a time:
	`
	#!/bin/sh
	curl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu
	`

	My answer:

	`echo '#!/bin/sh' >> semester
	 echo 'curl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu' >> semester`

	The result looks like this:

	![File with lines of code appended using the echo bash command](../../../images/missing/missing_l1_q4_result.png "File with lines of code appended using the echo bash command")

5. Try to execute the file, i.e. type the path to the script (`./semester`) into your shell and press enter. Understand why it doesn’t work by consulting the output of ls (hint: look at the permission bits of the file).
	
	When I try to execute the script via `./semester` I am met with this:
	![Permission denied response from shell after executing command](../../../images/missing/missing_l1_q5_denied.png "Permission denied response from shell after executing command")

	If I check the permissions of the file by typing `ls -l` I see this:
	![See that the permissions for the file does not allow it to be executed](../../../images/missing/missing_l1_q5_permissions.png "See that the permissions for the file does not allow it to be executed")

	This tells me that the file only has read and write permissions (denoted by the first `rw`), but no executable (`x`) permission.


6. Run the command by explicitly starting the `sh` interpreter, and giving it the file `semester` as the first argument, i.e. `sh semester`. Why does this work, while `./semester` didn’t?

	By running the command `sh semester` the file is executed and a `curl` request is made for the end point which displays the request data in the shell. `./semester` isn't executable because of the file permissions. `sh` works because we are passing the file to the interpreter as an argument, so it will execute the script. ([resource](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/101170/why-do-i-need-to-put-sh-before-running-sh-files) for this explanation)

7. Look up the `chmod` program (e.g. use `man chmod`).

	Looking at the `man` page for `chmod`, it says that the program is used to change file modes or [Access Control Lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list). This is a very detailed `man` page that gives a lot of useful information and examples.

8. Use `chmod` to make it possible to run the command `./semester` rather than having to type `sh semester`. How does your shell know that the file is supposed to be interpreted using `sh`? See this page on the [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) line for more information.

	My answer:
	What we need to do is make the `semester` file executable. To do this I can run the command `chmod 0100 semester` and this allows me to execute the `semester` command successfully. After changing the permissions, I run `ls -l` and see this:

	![The permissions of the file now allow it to be executable](../../../images/missing/missing_l1_q8_permissions.png "The permissions of the file now allow it to be executable")

9. Use `|` and `>` to write the “last modified” date output by `semester` into a file called `last-modified.txt` in your home directory.

	My answer:
	`date -r semester > ~/last-modified.txt`

	I'm not sure how I could use the pipe operator in this context so any suggestions are welcome.

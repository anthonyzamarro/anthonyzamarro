# SSH

## What is it?

SSH is a way to securely connect to a remote server.

Instead of constantly entering a password to log in, you have a public and a private key. These are hashes that you generate. They can be SHA-256 or some other hashing algorithm. Your private key always stays on your machine while you can place your public key into the server you want to connect to. The server will always know that you are connecting to it because you have the private key on your machine, so this will ensure that you are the only one who can connect.
